# Overview 

Managing workflows can be time consuming. Most managers find approving employee logs, times and pay a little more challenging to maintain over time. This solution is built to develop a web3 approach to a real world workflow problem. An idea inspired by The Source Project I was able to bring smart contract approval to a simple workflow environment.

# On Chain Platform

Ginop provides in memory blockchain for saftey and security. This decision is based on a cost effective approach to implementing smart contract verification. The onChain approach to employee workflow will allow self service check-in/check-out stations. This original idea is based on proof of concept and will expand deeper into other implementations such as geospatial, sms, and biometric based proof of concepts.

# API

Our smart contracts will govern our endpoints allowing for new workflows to progress overtime.

```python
#create transaction
clock-in/ 

#sign transaction
clock-out/ 
```

# Smart Contract example using web3.py

```python
import json
from web3 import Web3

# Set up web3 connection with Ganache
ganache_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7545"
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(ganache_url))

# Set a default account to sign transactions - this account is unlocked with Ganache
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0]

# Greeter contract ABI
abi = json.loads('[{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"_greeting","type":"string"}],"name":"setGreeting","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"greet","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"greeting","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"}]')

# Greeter contract address - convert to checksum address
address = web3.toChecksumAddress('') # FILL ME IN

# Initialize contract
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=address, abi=abi)\

# Read the default greeting
print(contract.functions.greet().call())

# Set a new greeting
tx_hash = contract.functions.setGreeting('HEELLLLOOOOOO!!!').transact()

# Wait for transaction to be mined
web3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

# Display the new greeting value
print('Updated contract greeting: {}'.format(
    contract.functions.greet().call()
))
```
