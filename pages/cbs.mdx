# Chain Based Signatures (CBS)

CBS was built on top of existing blockchain based implementations with the idea of signatures that manage protocol-specific functionality. This implementation is composed of different parts, each of which is responsible for verification of protocol-specific domains. Modeling the current blockchain ecosystem makes it easy to maintain signatures and integrate new protocol-specific functionality.

Let's dive into an overview of the current implementation.
