# Introduction

**Source Project** is an open-source community for building workflow-based solutions for electronic signatures and verification systems.

## Why?

Users should consistently rely on habits that make their work easier. We provide electronic verification signatures using blockchain technology to build sustainable and trusted software.
Our implementation is bounded by SMS, biometric, geospatial, and time formatted signatures. The scope of Source Projects applications will cover areas like data backup & recovery, on-chain contract-based verification identifiers, and protocols for products. 

The Source Project offers [data recovery & backup](/data-backup) as well as protocol signatures. 
Need to backup important data? Does your data need to be HIPAA compliant? Have trouble organizing and securing workflow checks on simple tasks? We've got you covered!

## Community driven

The best developers are product-first individuals, which is what we focus on for our libraries. Source Project molds experience and knowledge in several key areas to cover a landscape of different applications across the board.
