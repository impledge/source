# Introduction

**Source Project** is a open-source community for building workflow based solutions for electonic signatures and verification systems.

## Why?

Users should consistently rely on habits that make their work easier. We provide electronic verification signatures using blockchain technology to build sustainable and trusted software.
Our implementation is based on programatically tailored solutions to sms, biometric, geospacial, and time formatted signatures. The scope of Source Projects applications will cover areas like data backup & recover, on-chain contract based verification identifiers, and protocols to meet the needs of the application. 

The Source Project offers data recovery & backup as well as protocol-verification. 
Need to backup important data? Does your data need to be HIPAA compliant? Having trouble organizing and securing workflow checks on simple task? We've got you covered!

## Community driven

The best developers are product-first individuals, which is what we focus on for our libraries. Source Project molds experience and knowledge in several key areas to create a meaningful solution. Our libraries cover a landscape of different applications across the board, but overall our implementation is based on data, verification, and protocol.
