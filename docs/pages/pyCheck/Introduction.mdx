# Overview (Coming soon...)

Cyclic Redundancy Check algorithms are used to vacilitate communication from one node to another in a distributed network. Most CRC tools are based on low-level checks that arent 100% reliable in a long term test environment. We aim to solve this by using web3 technology to ensure safe checks. This is currently in development!
